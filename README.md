                                                  # About the Project: 

The advancement in technology has made our lives easy like never before.  Everything that we require is available at our fingertips. With few taps on our smartphones, we can complete tasks in minimal time.
 
From entertainment to learning and from fitness to cooking, there are various applications for everything that we need. With just a click of a button, you can get access to multiple recipes within a  second.
 
Each recipe provides you with all the information,  from the ingredients required to each step required to cook the different parts of the dish. These applications are generally used by people who want to try to make some new dish, or by people who live all by themselves, or by working people who are always short on time.
 
Even though there has been such a huge advancement in technology, all these applications provide you with the ingredients required, and you must go and buy the ingredients that are not available to you currently.
 
 
The solution we came to is an Android Application/Website that will provide you recipes based on the ingredients that you already have with you, resulting in less wastage of time and money in buying the unavailable ingredients. The application contains an available database of food recipes that can be browsed through by the user. Most importantly the user can choose to only see those recipes with a specific set of ingredients available to them. The user also has the option to filter, sort, and favorite those recipes based on their preference. Moreover, the application also allows the user to add new recipes and ingredients to the application.
